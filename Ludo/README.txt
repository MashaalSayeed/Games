   Python Ludo Game
=========================
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish
in a clockwise order according to the rolls of a single die.

         Rules
=========================
1. To start moving a piece across the board, you must roll a 6. If a 6 is not rolled, next player rolls the dice
2. If you get a 6, you get to roll the dice again
3. It is possible to capture an enemy piece by landing on the same tile it is in, Capturing cannot be done if the tile is
   a spawn or safe tile. A captured piece moves back to its base where it must get a 6 to spawn again. You also get a chance
   to roll again
4. Spawn tile is the initial starting point of each colored piece, A safe tile is one with a star on it
5. After moving a single piece more than 50 times, it enters its respective home path
6. In order to reach the home tile it must get exactly 56 moves.
7. Get all your pieces to the home tile to win the game!
